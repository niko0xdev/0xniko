# Niko's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, a static site generator (SSG). The portfolio website is hosted at [https://portfolio.nikoder.dev](https://portfolio.nikoder.dev).

## Quick Start Development Guide

To start working on my personal portfolio locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/niko0xdev/nikoder.dev.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   cd nikoder.dev
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

   The development server will start, and you can view the portfolio website by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4. **Customize the content:**

   - Open the `data` directory to find the data files for different sections of the portfolio.
   - Modify the content in these files to add your own information, such as your projects, skills, experience, and contact details.
   - Update the styles and components in the `components` directory to match your desired design.

5. **Build for production:**

   When you're ready to deploy your portfolio, run the following command:

   ```
   yarn bundle
   ```

   This will generate an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

6. **Deploy to your preferred hosting platform:**

   You can deploy your portfolio website to any hosting platform that supports static site hosting. Simply upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting provider.
